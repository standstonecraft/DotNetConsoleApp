# DotNetConsoleApp
.NET Framework and SQL Server console app with VS Code

If you create a .NET Framework project (not .NET Core),
auto-generated `launch.json` will not work
because that is template for .NET Core app.  
`launch.json` in this project will workðŸ˜Ž

This project include tests in test folder.
So `tasks.json` is defferent from default.
